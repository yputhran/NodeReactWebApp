The best 2 projects that I have worked on till date were during my Software Developer position at MOI INC; where I developed an B2C cosmetics and healthcare application for MOI created in an AngularJS framework with MongoDB database hosted on the AWS server Instance which will automate and integrate the booking system with the CMS system of the cosmetics and healthcare brands signed up. The other project which was a ‘Employee tracking, authentication and payroll system’ in which the front end was created with Bootstrap UI components using HTML,CSS and were integrated with the Java backend using REST service with JSON objects.
